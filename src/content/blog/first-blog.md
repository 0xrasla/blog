Learning to code can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be a challenging and frustrating one. Many people start out with high hopes and enthusiasm, but eventually lose steam and give up. Why is that?

### It's not as easy as it looks

Coding is not something that you can just pick up overnight. It takes time and effort to learn and master the skills needed to become a proficient programmer. It requires a lot of patience, persistence, and dedication. There are no shortcuts to learning to code.

### Lack of resources or support

People may not have access to good tutorials, mentors, or communities that can help them along the way. They may feel like they're on their own, struggling to make sense of complex concepts and syntax. Without the right resources and support, it can be difficult to stay motivated and engaged.

### Lack of motivation

People may not have a clear goal in mind, or they may not be driven by a strong desire to learn. They may be easily discouraged by setbacks or failures, and they may not be willing to put in the time and effort required to overcome obstacles. Learning to code requires a lot of motivation and drive.

### Wrong mindset

People may be too focused on the end result, rather than the process of learning. They may be too hard on themselves when they make mistakes, rather than seeing them as opportunities to learn and grow. They may be too quick to give up, rather than persevering and pushing through the tough times.

So what can we do to help people stick with learning to code? First, we can provide them with the right resources and support. We can connect them with mentors, tutorials, and communities that can help them learn and grow. We can also help them set clear goals and stay motivated. We can encourage them to focus on the process of learning, rather than the end result. And we can help them develop a growth mindset, one that is open to learning and growth, and that is not afraid to make mistakes.

By providing the right resources and support, and by helping people develop the right mindset, we can help them stick with learning to code and achieve their goals. We can help them see the value in learning to code, and we can help them stay motivated and engaged. And we can help them become proficient programmers, capable of creating amazing things and solving real-world problems.
